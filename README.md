# CleverCampus – Minimal College Finder

CleverCampus is a **minimal, straightforward college finder website** designed to help users explore colleges without unnecessary decoration or visual noise.

The focus is **clarity, speed, and usability** — no animations for the sake of animation, no distractions.

## Philosophy

Most educational websites are cluttered and over-designed.  
This project intentionally avoids that. NO NOISE, ONLY DIRECTION.

- Clear hierarchy
- Simple navigation
- Information-first layout
- Minimal UI, maximum intent

---

## Features

- Stream-based navigation (Engineering, Business, Design, Medical, Law, Arts)
- College cards with essential data:
  - Location
  - Fees
  - Entrance exam
  - 12th criteria
  - Average package
- Filter-based exploration
- Clean transitions (no heavy effects)
- Fully responsive layout

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – layout and styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – navigation, transitions, logic(with some limited use of a.i)

No frameworks. No libraries. No bloat.
